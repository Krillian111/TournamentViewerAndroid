- switch button texts for proper icons (add, delete, signup etc.)

- add custom launcher icon

- toast for succesfully adding a player (and succesful actions in general)

- add number of selected players at bottom (player selection)

- prevent negative input in basic setup

minor features:
- external ladder from start screen (sorting based on rank; seperate sorted copy of list necessary?)

major features:
- add more sophisticated rating (e.g. elo)
- add mode dyp
- add mode fixed teams

System for matchmaking
########################
Assuming a list of ranked players, for each game and each team do the following:
1. Pick a random player
2. Pick his partner using a gaussian distribution, centering it at the complementary position in the ladder
(i.e. a top player picks his partner from a gaussian distribution over all player with the peak of the g.d. being at
the worst player, a mediocre player player picks his partner from a g.d. over all players with the peak being in the
middle)
3. special case: player already played with selected partner -> redraw partner unless partner was already drawn
several times (therefore it is not impossible for same team to occur, just less likely)
