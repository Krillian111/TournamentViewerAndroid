TODOs:

- save player list permanently

- inconsistency regarding sorting of players with equal games played

- add entity Match to allow multiple modelling games

- add win/losses/ties etc. for tournament (otherwise only accumulated games etc. are displayed)
-- calculate ranking score as ratio of currentWins/currentGames

- check for at least 2 or 4 players when starting tournament

- unit tests (entities)

- implement safety against silent process killing by android:
-- AppManager is not initialized by default
-- getInstance checks for initialized, else initializes all Managers -> no active initialization by StartActivity necessary
-- implement Parcelable for Tournament (implies Game and Player)
-- save Tournament in correct method (onDestroy?)
-- all other activities should be checked to work without saving a state

- switch button texts for proper images (add, delete, signup etc.)
