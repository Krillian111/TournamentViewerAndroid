System for matchmaking
########################
Assuming a list of ranked players, for each game and each team do the following:
1. Pick a random player
2. Pick his partner using a gaussian distribution, centering it at the complementary position in the ladder
(i.e. a top player picks his partner from a gaussian distribution over all player with the peak of the g.d. being at
the worst player, a mediocre player player picks his partner from a g.d. over all players with the peak being in the
middle)
3. special case: player already played with selected partner -> redraw partner unless partner was already drawn
several times (therefore it is not impossible for same team to occur, just less likely)
