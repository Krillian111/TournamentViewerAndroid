TODOs:
- TournamentManager

- entity tournament (if necessary)

- interface MatchmakingUtil (specifically MonsterDYP)

- MonsterDYPMatchmakingUtil implements MatchmakingUtil

- unit tests (entities)

- implement safety against silent process killing by android:
-- AppManager is not initialized by default
-- getInstance checks for initialized, else initializes all Managers -> no active initialization by StartActivity necessary
-- implement Parcelable for Tournament (implies Game and Player)
-- save Tournament in correct method (onDestroy?)
-- all other activities should be checked to work without saving a state
